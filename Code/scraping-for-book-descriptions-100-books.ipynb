It begins with the story of her mothers--Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah--the four wives of Jacob. They love Dinah and give her gifts that sustain her through a hard-working youth, a calling to midwifery, and a new home in a foreign land. Dinah's story reaches out from a remarkable period of early history and creates an intimate connection with the past. Deeply affecting, The Red Tent combines rich storytelling with a valuable achievement in modern fiction: a new view of biblical women's society.\", 'ISBN': '0312195516'}]\n"]}],"source":["book_info_list = [get_book_info(isbn) for isbn in top_reviewed]\n","\n","print(book_info_list[:5])            "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["There are only 5 books that we couldn't find.
